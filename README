P1: Chess
---------
Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
The program is complete. No assumptions are made.

Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
I solved the problem by using 2D array simply. First I initialized the array with starting configuration of chess board. Then I used various regular expressions to represent every possible move in chess with given constraints.

P2: Calculator
--------------
Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
The program is complete. I have assumed that input of type integer will be a valid identifier which will be in the format : "identifier: int" ,i.e, there is a whitespace between : and int. I have also assumed that when we are calling to readInt method in the Input file, it will be given in the following format : "identifier = readInt",i.e, there is whitespace between identifier and = , also a whitespace between = and readInt.

Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
I solved the problem by using regular expressions and lex grammar symbol specifications to represent every possible line in the Input file. I also used some functions like strlen, strcat, strtok, etc. to get output in required format. I have also taken care of indentation so that it produces a well-indented C program as the output which makes it more readable and presentable.
